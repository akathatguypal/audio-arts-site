            <p>Audio Arts Collective is a platform dedicated to supporting independent artists by offering free music distribution services. Originally founded under the name VICE Entertainment, and later known as Zilnic Music Group, we've evolved into a brand that puts creative freedom first. Audio Arts is here to help emerging artists get their music heard â€” without any costs or catch.</p>
